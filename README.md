## How to Protect Yourself Against Phishing

Phishing is a common type of cyber attack where attackers try to trick you into giving them sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card details by pretending to be a trustworthy entity.

Here are some key things to look out for to protect yourself:

### 1. Check the Sender's Information
- **From Address:** Look closely at the sender's email address. Phishers often use email addresses that are very similar to legitimate ones, but with a slight misspelling or a different domain (e.g., `service@go0gle.com` instead of `service@google.com`).
- **Sender Name:** Be aware that the sender's display name can be easily faked.

### 2. Look for Generic Greetings
- Legitimate companies you do business with will often address you by your name. Be suspicious of generic greetings like "Dear Valued Customer" or "Dear Sir/Madam."

### 3. Hover Before You Click
- Before clicking on any links, hover your mouse over them to see the actual URL they lead to. If the URL looks suspicious or doesn't match the context of the email, don't click it.

### 4. Beware of Urgency and Threats
- Phishing emails often try to create a sense of urgency or fear. They might say your account will be closed, you've won a prize you must claim immediately, or that there's a security issue with your account.

### 5. Check for Spelling and Grammar Mistakes
- While not always the case, many phishing emails are poorly written and contain spelling or grammatical errors.

### 6. Don't Open Unexpected Attachments
- Be cautious with email attachments, especially from unknown senders. They can contain malware that will infect your computer.

### 7. Verify Requests Independently
- If you receive a suspicious request from what appears to be a legitimate organization (like your bank), don't use the contact information in the email. Instead, go to their official website or use a phone number you know is legitimate to verify the request.

Stay safe online!
